## Welcome To Mike's Cantina

Welcome to Mike's Cantina. Mike's Cantina is a rails based application that stores a collection of the best cocktail recipes. A user that signs up can share their favorite cocktail recipes and browse through a collection of cocktail recipes submitted by other users. In addition, a user can also edit their cocktail recipes and comment on all cocktail recipes. A user has a profile page which displays the cocktail recipe of the day, the most talked about cocktail recipe, and the five newest recipes. Cocktail recipes can be browsed by their user, title, ingredients, and category.
